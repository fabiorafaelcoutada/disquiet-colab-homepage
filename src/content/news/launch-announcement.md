Today marks the official launch of the new Disquiet CoLab homepage. This project was built using the latest Next.js features, focusing on performance, mobile-first design, and a modular content management system built around Markdown.

The new site serves as both a client showcase and a powerful content platform for our technical insights. We look forward to populating the blog and news sections with updates soon!
